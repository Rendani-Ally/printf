<p align="center">
    The printf project is a collaboration project by <a href="https://github.com/Rendani-Ally">Rendani Ally<a/> and <a href="https://github.com/0506Andy">Thandi Andile Ndlovu<a/>, students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme by Holberton School, in which a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".
    <br />
	
	int _printf(const char *format, ...)


	The format tags prototype is the following:

	%[flags][length]specifier

    <br />
    If the program runs successfully, the **return value** is the amount of chars printed.
